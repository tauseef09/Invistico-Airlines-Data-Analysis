# Invistico Airlines Data Analysis
This data analysis task was given as a challenge in Alankan. Alankan was a data science competition organized by IIT Roorkie, India in 
April, 2021. The dataset was of a hypothetical airlines company named "Invistico Airlines". The task was to analyse the data, create models
to predict customer satisfaction levels with the highest accuracy, and finally figure out the most impactful features that were effecting the 
customer satisfaction.
